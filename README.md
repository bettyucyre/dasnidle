# How to Get Unbanned on Deadside (2025 Guide) 🪓

Getting banned from Deadside can feel like getting kicked out of your favorite zombie party. But fear not! This friendly guide will walk you through what to do if you find yourself banned and how to appeal to get your survival skills back online.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban strike like an undead sniper right after making a new account? Or do bans keep following you around like a persistent horde? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Deadside has locked onto your PC’s hardware fingerprint, making new accounts a no-go without some extra tricks.

Using an HWID spoofer is like giving your PC a fake ID, helping you sneak back into the wastelands if you’re caught in a hardware ban.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or messages from the Deadside team or their platform to find your ban’s backstory. Typical ban triggers include:
- Cheating with hacks or mods  
- Toxic, rage-fueled rants or harassment  
- Account sharing shenanigans or suspicious logins  

**Pro tip:** Re-read Deadside’s terms before you hit send on your appeal — the last thing you want is to fight a battle you can’t win.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

Before you knock on Deadside’s door, gather:
- Your game account email address  
- Your Deadside username or player ID  
- The exact date your ban landed  
- Any screenshots or ban notification messages

## Step 3: Submit a Ban Appeal 📧

Head over to [the official Deadside support or ban appeal page](https://help.ea.com/en/help/account/information-about-banned-or-suspended-accounts/) and log in. Fill out the appeal form with your info. If they allow emails, here’s a cheeky template to get you started:

> **Subject:** Deadside Ban Appeal - [Your Username]  
>  
> Dear Deadside Support Team,  
>  
> I recently got banned on my Deadside account ([Your Username] / [Email Address]) on [Date]. I’m pretty sure this was an honest mistake, and I’d love for you to take another look.  
>  
> I play by the rules and have never intentionally broken Deadside’s policies. If you need anything else from me to clear things up, just ask!
